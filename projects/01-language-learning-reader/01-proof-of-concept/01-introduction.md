Right now I'm learning Chinese. A year and a half ago I wanted to find a tool that helped me learn to read Chinese by giving pronunciation help and English definitions just for the characters I didn't know. I couldn't find a tool like this so I built one. 

The tool is kind of like my own private Chinese teacher, always ready to help me read Chinese by explaining new characters using English. It's a wonderful help, but now I want to improve it. I want a tool that can help me learn to read in any language using any language, not just Chinese using English.

You're here because you want to improve your understanding of JavaScript and how to build web applications. Maybe you would also like to improve your understanding of another language? Great! I'm glad you've joined.

To build a web application we start with the **end** in mind, we determine our goal by asking a few questions:

- **What would we like to build?**
  - A language learning reader that can use any language to help you learn to read in any language. We'll start by using Mandarin to learn Classical Chinese. 
- **Why?**
  - Because we want to make language learning faster, more useful, and more enjoyable.
- **How will this tool improve our life after we build it?**
  - We will find it easier to read difficult material.

Now that we know what we are going to build, I want you to join me in writing every single line of code, frontend and backend, so you can become better at building useful web applications. Then, if you're a language learner (I hope you are), you can use it and make it even better! Let's get started!
