We now have a working proof of concept. It's very simple and has lots of problems (e.g. dictionary definitions are in simplified and interface is in tradtional script), but it works! 

Now that we have completed a proof of concept and discovered a little about how we could build a tool to help us read a Classical text, we can take a break from programming to make a list of tasks needing accomplished before this tool is actually useful for **anyone** reading **any** Classical text.

Future lessons will each go through one of these tasks. We will learn many different important aspects of building a web app, including but not limited to:

- User authentication
- Database storage
- Using a styles framework
- Hosting
