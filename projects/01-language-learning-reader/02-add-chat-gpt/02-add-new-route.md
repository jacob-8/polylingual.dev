Start by adding an `/explain` route where we can place our new interface. We do this in SvelteKit by adding a `src/routes/explain/+page.svelte` file.

> **Tip:** You can click file names in the code snippets to open them in your editor. If they are not yet created, they will also be created.

Then let's set up a basic form structure:

[[src/routes/explain/+page.svelte#02]]
