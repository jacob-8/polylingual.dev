To find the definition of a word in a foreign language we can use a dctionary. To get a translation of a sentence we can use the Google Translate API (or many other similar services). To get the translation of an older language into modern speech we have a new option: ChatGPT. It understands older languages like Classical Chinese and Shakespearean English because it has been trained on many works of literture as well as their commentaries. Consulting a resource like the [Chinese Text Project](https://ctext.org/) used to be our only option for getting help in understanding older literature. But now we can use AI to speed up our research and bring the answers right into our app just when we need them.
